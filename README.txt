# Sapiencss

This is a simple programming language that's similar to human speech and can currently draw simple shapes like a rectangle, circle and a line to the screen based on the x-coordinate, y-coordinate, width, height, radius, length and other mentioned attributes.

Here's an example of the syntax:

```
MAKE RECTANGLE "r1" WITH color "red", x "10", y "10", width "5", height "10";
MAKE CIRCLE "c1" WITH color "yellow", x "20", y "30", radius "5";
MAKE LINE "l1" WITH color "teal", x "5", y "15", length "15";
```

This block of code generates the following image :
